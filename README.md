# sleep-disorder-prediction-logistic-regression
A Machine Learning model that predicts sleep disorders using Logistic Regression with 87% accuracy. It analyzes health and lifestyle factors like age, BMI, stress, and sleep habits. Helps identify risks of insomnia, sleep apnea, and other disorders for early intervention. Built using Python, Scikit-learn, and real-world healthcare data.
